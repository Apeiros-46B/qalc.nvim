TODO before merging rewrite->main
- write cmake package for libqalculate, that way we don't have to rely on pkg-config
- fix :QalcYank
- currently there is an issue when typing in a variable assignment, and then deleting it. the variable persists (e.g. type x=10, delete the line, then x is still 10)
- need to test functionality with multiple buffers
